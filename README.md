Some rules (Please read before checking in code)
1. Name your pr in the format of 'pr-########'
2. Please try not to submit iPython notebook files since it is difficult to view on github.com. Convert your ipynb file to a py file before submission
3. File names are preferred in lowercase for all letters
4. Unit tests are a must especially when you write Python libraries
