This repo includes all the work from Mapping Algo team which covers computer vision and machine learning effort done to scale maps.
Some rules (Please read before checking in code)
Name your pr in the format of 'pr-########'
Please try not to submit iPython notebook files since it is difficult to view on github.com. Convert your ipynb file to a py file before submission
File names are preferred in lowercase for all letters
Unit tests are a must especially when you write Python libraries
